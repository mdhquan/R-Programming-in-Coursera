## Question 1-7 require no code
# Question 8
x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE)
y<-x[[1]]
class(y)

# Question 9
x<-1:4
y<-2:3
x+y

# Question 10
x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6)
x[x < 6] <- 0

# Question 11
data<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Quan Mai\\Downloads\\Video\\Compressed\\hw1_data.csv")
str(data)
head (data)

# Question 12

### Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

data[1:2,]

# Question 13

### How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?
nrow (data)

# Question 14
### Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

data[152:153,]

# Question 15
### What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
data[47,1]

# Question 16
###How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
length(data$Ozone)
t<-na.omit(data$Ozone)
length(t)
length(data$Ozone)-length(t)

# Question 17
### What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation 

mean(t.)

# Question 18
### Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?
y<-subset(data,Ozone>31)
z<-subset(y,Temp>90)
mean(z$Solar.R)

# Question 19
### What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6? 
k<-subset(data,Month==6)
mean(k$Temp)

# Question 20
### What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?
 f<-subset(data,Month==5)
max(na.omit(f$Ozone))
